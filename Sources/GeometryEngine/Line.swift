/// A line in 2D space.

/// A line is represented by two `Vector2D` instances. It can then be used for composing polygons. You create a new `Line` by giving its twos points.

///     // Creates a line from (0, 0) to (1, 0).
///     let line = Line([0, 0], [1, 0])

    var p2: Vector2D
    
    /// The vector from the first to the second point.
    var vector: Vector2D { p2 - p1 }

    var maxY: Double { max(p1.y, p2.y) }
